Hey there!
It's me {~}{#b63f36}TART{#}{/~}
Someone before me decided to put a dialogue box in this room,{n}{0.5} but forgot to associate any dialouge with it...
Anyways sorry to say this room is like {0.25}{!}GM+7{/!}.
Don't worry though,{0.5} I put a trigger to skip the whole thing in that comfy spot the arrow is pointing to.
Have fun,{0.5} I'll be seeing you later probably.{#}

{~}{#b63f36}TART{#}{/~} here seeing you (probably) again.
That dialouge back there wasn't actually added by me.
It was added by aletris.
No thanks to my hard drive {~}dying{/~}.{#}

You read the text.
