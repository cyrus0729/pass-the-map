# pass the map
originally started by lirachonyr, organized by aletris to prevent it from devolving into chaos <br/>
if you wanna get into the queue to map ask me or any contributors <br/>
if you wanna be a contributor to accept submissions ask me <br/>
try your best to make a pull request instead of having to ping me on discord <br/>
(if you don't know how to make a pull request then just ping me on discord) <br/>
